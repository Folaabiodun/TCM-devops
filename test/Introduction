Hello, my name is Folakemi Abiodun, a wife, mother to 4 beautiful kids (2 boys and 2 girls) and owner of Fabzluxe Naturals LLC (a hair care product brand).

I started my career as a banker in Nigeria but had to move to the United States to be with my Husband.
I have been a stay at home mum for the past 6 years but now ready to go back to work fully which led to me transitioning into the I.T field focusing on DevOps.
I'm excited to share with you my aspirations and goals for the next five years.
I believe that setting clear objectives helps me stay focused and motivated, and I'm eager to share my vision with you.

Goals/Visions:

Professional Development: Over the next five years, I aim to grow both personally and professionally.
I plan to enhance my skills in Devops Engineering through continuous learning, attending relevant workshops, and taking on challenging projects.
My goal is to become an expert in my field and make significant contributions to my industry.

Career Advancement: Within the next five years, I aspire to take on increasing levels of responsibility and leadership within my organization.
I plan to demonstrate my abilities by consistently delivering high-quality projects and exceeding expectations.
By the end of this period, I aim to be in a managerial or senior position that allows me to make strategic decisions and drive meaningful change.

Entrepreneurial Endeavours: In the next five years, I also envision myself growing my  hair care products business (Fabzluxe Naturals) to a houehold name brand.
I'm passionate about natural hair, and I believe there are untapped opportunities waiting to be explored.
I plan to conduct thorough market research, build a strong network, and acquire the necessary skills and resources to turn my entrepreneurial vision into a reality.

Personal Growth and Well-being: Alongside my professional goals, I recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
I intend to prioritize my physical and mental well-being by incorporating regular exercise, mindfulness practices, and quality time with loved ones into my routine.
By doing so, I aim to enhance my overall happiness and productivity.

Social Impact: Making a positive difference in the lives of others is a fundamental part of my long-term vision.
I intend to actively contribute to social causes and give back to my community.
Whether through volunteering, mentorship programs, or philanthropic endeavours (having my own NGO in Nigeria), my goal is to leave a lasting impact and create a better world.

In conclusion, my goals for the next five years encompass professional growth, career advancement, entrepreneurship, personal well-being, and social impact.
By pursuing these objectives, I aim to continuously learn, challenge myself, and make a meaningful difference.
I'm excited about the journey ahead and the opportunities that lie within it.
